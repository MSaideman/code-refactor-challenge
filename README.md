# Code Refactor Challenge

This project is the first HTML, CSS, Git assignment through UCSD Extension's coding bootcamp. The challenge is to use existing code to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. Horiseon marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their own site is optimized for search engines. A successful project goes above and beyond for clients by exceeding expectations and improving the codebase for long-term sustainability.
